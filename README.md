# Seti Settings for Base16-builder

This is an adaptation of the great [Set Theme](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-syntax) for the Atom Editor by
[Jesse Weed](https://github.com/jesseweed).

I take no credit for the choice of colours or creativity that certaily went into this,
I merly made it work with the equally fantastic [base16-builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder).

I hope you enjoy.
